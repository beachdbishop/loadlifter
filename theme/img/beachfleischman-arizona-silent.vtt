This is a silent video.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500 
It shows various scenes across the state of Arizona starting with the sun rising over the Sonoran desert.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.500 
We slowly soar around the buildings in downtown Tucson.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000 
We then see beautiful, snow-dusted, red rocks near Sedona,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.500 
yellow flower and saguaro-covered hills,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
and finally, brightly lit Phoenix in the evening.
